## Overview
This is a **grid-based memory game** where players flip cards to find matching pairs.  
The project includes a **persistent save system** using JSON files in `Application.persistentDataPath`, ensuring the game state (card order, matched cards, score, and timer) is restored exactly when the player clicks **Continue**.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Layout** â€“ Select rows and columns before starting the game.
- **Randomized Card Order** â€“ Cards are shuffled at the start.
- **Persistent Save System** â€“ Stores:
  - Grid size
  - Card order
  - Matched card indexes
  - Score
  - Elapsed time
- **Continue Game Support** â€“ Resume exactly where you left off.
- **Game Over Cleanup** â€“ Automatically deletes the save file and resets PlayerPrefs when the game ends.
- **Sound Effects** â€“ Flip, match, mismatch, and game over sounds.
- **Scalable Design** â€“ Easily change the number of sprites, grid layout, and match logic.

   - Restores card positions
   - Turns on already matched cards
   - Restores score & timer
4. **On Game Over** â†’ Deletes save file & related PlayerPrefs.
